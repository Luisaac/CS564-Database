About the JDBC:

I do not know how to make a executable file for JDBC. According to the piazza, I can just submit my java file.


Here is how I compile it: 

1. Download postgresql-8.4-703.jdbc4.jar

2. Create login.config be like

	pgjdbc {
	com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required useTicketCache=true
	debug=true;
	};

3. Put them together with my java file JDBCSampling.java.

4. Use given command to set path and classpath in terminal:

	export CLASSPATH=postgresql-8.4-703.jdbc4.jar:.
	export PATH=//usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0/bin:$PATH
	alias javasec='java -Djava.security.auth.login.config=login.config'

5. Compile it by command:
	javac JDBCSampling.java

6. Run it by command:
	javasec JDBCSampling


Clarification for the first prompt:

"Enter the table name or specific query for sampling:
(You can also use query other than select)"

If you type tablename or select, it will continue do the sampling.
If you type other query, it will execute and loop back.


We also assume following:
1. User will input all query in one single line.
2. User will use non-existed table name when he store the sample back to database.
