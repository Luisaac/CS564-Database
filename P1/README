We use java to decompose the relation.
Simply put the java code and csv file under the same directory to run.

For evevery line we read in:
1. Use String.split(",") to separate data by comma.
2. Use hashset which stores the keys to avoid duplication.
3. Write specific column(by the index of String array which returned by split) to the four new files(relations).
